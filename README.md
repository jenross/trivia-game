See how much you know about the Pawnee Parks and Recreation department and the people who make it great. You have 20 seconds to answer each of the 12 questions in this trivia game. Good luck! 

I made this game with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery for the UCF Coding Boot Camp week 5 homework. I utilized timer functions to give the user a 20-second time limit for each question. After submitting the answer to a question, the response and a correlating gif or image displays for 5 seconds before automatically cycling to the next question. 

This was the first time I added time constraints to a project and now feel much more comfortable doing this going forward.
